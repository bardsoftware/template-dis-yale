Yale Dissertation Template

Layout should be in conformity with the October 2006 Yale GSAS "Preparation and Submission of the Doctoral Dissertation".
First, get a copy of the booklet "Preparation and submission of the Doctoral Dissertation" from the Graduate School.  Then, ask your department and advisor if there any other requirements.
This class conforms to the Graduate School's current requirements (as of March 2000), in the sense that it was accepted without any quibbles.  However, requirements change, so check the fine print. Also, some departments may have additional requirements which are not included in this class.
Since ultimate responsibility rests with you, the candidate, you should verify that the resulting dissertation meets requirements of your department and the Graduate School.
